### [ ] Tiered Access & Subscriptions (Priority: High)

*   **Missing:** No platform-wide analytics for the admin.

### [ ] Advanced Payment Logic (Priority: Medium)
*   **Task:** Integrate recurring payments for subscriptions.
*   **Missing:** Current payment system supports one-off transactions but not subscriptions.

### [ ] Case Tracking & Document Management (Priority: Low)

## 3. Recommended Step-by-Step Implementation

1.  **Step 1: Subscription Model:** Create a `subscription.dart` model and a `SubscriptionProvider`.
2.  **Step 2: Access Gating:** Update `HomeScreen` and `GigDetailsScreen` to check if a Senior Lawyer has an active subscription before allowing them to view/apply.
3.  **Step 3: Billing Integration:** Connect the `PaymentProvider` to a mock or real payment gateway (like Stripe) for recurring monthly fees.
4.  **Step 4: Admin Role:** Add `admin` to `UserRole` and create a simple protected route for platform moderation.
5.  **Step 5: Document Support:** Enhance the chat/gig system to allow PDF uploads for legal documents.

## 4. Strategic Considerations: Why Junior Lawyers Should Pay (For Client Discussion)

While offering free access to junior lawyers (<5 years) encourages growth, there are strong arguments for charging them a nominal fee (e.g., "Early Career Tier"):

1.  **Commitment & Quality Control:** A small fee (even $5-10/month) filters out casual or inactive users, ensuring that the "Junior" pool consists of serious professionals who are actively looking for work.
2.  **Perceived Value:** People often undervalue what they get for free. Paying a small amount can make them take the platform and the opportunities it provides more seriously.
3.  **Identity Verification Cost:** Verifying a lawyer's credentials (bar status, background checks) costs money. A nominal fee can help cover these administrative overheads.
4.  **Habit Formation:** Getting users used to a payment workflow early on makes it easier to upsell them to a premium tier later as their career advances, rather than facing a "paywall shock" at the 5-year mark.
5.  **Revenue Diversification:** If the platform attracts thousands of junior lawyers, even a small fee adds up to significant operational revenue that can be reinvested into marketing to find them more clients.
