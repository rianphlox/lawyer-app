# Implementation Status and Feature Roadmap for LegalLink App

This document outlines potential features and pages to be added to the Flutter application to evolve it into a full-scale lawyer marketplace.

---

### 1. Monetization & Advanced Financials

These features are crucial for turning the app into a business and managing transactions securely.

*   **Subscription Management Screen:**
    *   **Description:** Allows lawyers to subscribe to different tiers (e.g., a "Pro" tier for higher visibility, more applications per month) and for clients to potentially access premium features.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented (exists in React sub-project).

*   **Detailed Transaction History:**
    *   **Description:** A dedicated screen that goes beyond the current `Earnings` and `Payments` pages. It should show a full ledger of all transactions, including gig payments, subscription fees, platform fees, and their status (pending, cleared, failed).
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Payout/Withdrawal Management:**
    *   **Description:** A secure area for lawyers to add and manage their bank account or payment provider details (like Stripe or PayPal) and request withdrawals of their earned funds.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Escrow System Interface:**
    *   **Description:** For building trust, payments for gigs should be held in an escrow account. The UI would need to show clients that their funds are "funded" and allow them to "release" payments upon milestone completion.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

### 2. Lawyer-Centric Features (To Attract & Retain Lawyers)

These features provide more value to the legal professionals on your platform.

*   **Lawyer Dashboard & Analytics:**
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive dashboard for lawyers showing key metrics like profile views, number of client contacts, application success rate, and earnings over time.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented (beyond basic earnings/applications).

*   **Appointment & Consultation Scheduling:**
    *   **Description:** A calendar interface where lawyers can set their availability and clients can book and pay for initial consultations directly through the app.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Client & Case Management Tools:**
    *   **Description:** A simple, built-in system for lawyers to manage their active cases, add private notes, and track statuses, separate from the public gig postings.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

### 3. Client-Centric Features (To Improve Client Experience)

These features make the app more useful and engaging for clients seeking legal help.

*   **Saved/Bookmarked Lawyers:**
    *   **Description:** A feature allowing clients to "favorite" or create a shortlist of lawyers they are interested in, making it easier to compare and contact them later.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Secure Document Vault:**
    *   **Description:** A dedicated and secure screen for each case where both client and lawyer can upload, view, and manage sensitive legal documents related to that case.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Milestone Tracking:**
    *   **Description:** A screen where the lawyer can define milestones for a gig, and the client can track progress and approve the completion of each milestone before releasing partial payments.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

### 4. Platform & Community Building

These features build trust, credibility, and a sense of community around your platform.

*   **Dispute Resolution Center:**
    *   **Description:** A formal system and interface for either a client or a lawyer to raise a dispute, which an administrator can then review and mediate.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Public Q&A Forum:**
    *   **Description:** A forum where potential clients can ask general legal questions. Lawyers can answer these questions to demonstrate their expertise, which can act as a powerful marketing tool for them on the platform.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.

*   **Help Center / Knowledge Base:**
    *   **Description:** A searchable collection of articles and FAQs to help users navigate the app and understand its processes.
    *   **Status:** Not implemented.
